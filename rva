RVA SMOG
















































<!-- Flag
    Blod Stained Banner aka 3rd flag of the Smogfederacy
        Black NW corner, filed of white, black stripe covering 1/8th (or i ss it 1/3rd?) east side. 
        4 Symbols of the Gang on the black striper of the east side vertically from top: Bones, Noose, Knife, Wrench,
    Knifes and Bones aka Smogfederate Battle Flag
        Black Flag, White Bars Shooting Diagonally from each corner into the center.
        Skull in White is affixed to the center of the flag, with the symbols surroudning in clockwise order from the NE Corner: Bones, Noose, Knife, Wrench.
        I'm not sure as of yet if the symbols would form an interlocking ribbon, or if you would have the symbols radiating from the sckull in the followign order always: bones, noose, knife, wrench. 
        I think the interlockign ribbon is best, strongest, but it would confuse me if it wasnt exaclty properly aligned so that each symbol ended abruptly and accurately at the correct place beneath and behind the central skull icon.
Hail satan the dark lord has risen, his commands are final and his order eternal praise be unton Damien his only son and the harbringer of flame. Lucien shall guide us into darkness.
