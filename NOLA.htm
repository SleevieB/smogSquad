                    This Flag didnt exist till 04 but thats ok we didnt exist until 9/11 and the arrow shape succintly communicates the feeling of a french variator sling shotting you through hyperspace and into the blaize dimension. The tree could be replaced by a dank leaf or a flame emoji because blaize it. Maybe the yellow star could be replaced by a WU Mono symbol, the middle being a flame, and then a smog symbol to the right to symbolise "WE CAME, WE BLAIZCED, WE CONQUERED" ?</p>

<!-- FlagS
    Based on Acadiana flags because I dont fuck with pelicans and the fleur dis lis NOla flag is too boring and our story more closeley refelcts the migratory tale of the Acadians from Canadia to the Delta. Plus it has better icons and is more obviously French.
The "Cajun" Acadian flag
    the yellow castle symbolizes the spanish welcome attitude toward the Acadian refugees and the help they offered these people, not suspecting that their culture, city, and lives would be overrun and dominated by this new populous. IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT SOMEONE NEED TO TELL MONO THIS A SMOG CITY.
The New England Acadian flag
    didnt exist till 04 but thats ok we didnt exist until 9/11 and the arrow shape succintly communicates the feeling of a french variator sling shotting you through hyperspace and into the blaize dimension. The tree could be replaced by a dank leaf or a flame emoji because blaize it. Maybe the yellow star could be replaced by a WU Mono symbol, the middle being a flame, and then a smog symbol to the right to symbolise "WE CAME, WE BLAIZCED, WE CONQUERED" ?
